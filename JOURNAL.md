# August 5th: Followed USB Hub Tutorial

I followed the usb hub tutorial and made my first pcb. It turns out it isn't as easy as I thought it was, but I did it.

**Total time spent: 1h**

# August 6th: MicroSD

I made a new version with a microsd card reader and a microsd to usb controller. That was so painful. It also looks really ugly.

# August 7th: Final Version

I made the final version, featuring a usb-c port to connect to a computer, two usb-a ports, one usb-c port, and a microsd card reader. I'm very proud of the final outcome, but there is a non-zero chance that it just completely doesn't work...
